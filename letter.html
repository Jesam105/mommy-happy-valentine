                Dear Mom,<br><br>
                There are not enough words in the world to express how much you mean to me and my sister. You have been our guiding light, our rock, and our source of unconditional love. Through every challenge, every tear, and every triumph, you have stood beside us with unwavering strength and grace.<br><br>
                Being a single mom is never easy, yet you made it look effortless. You sacrificed so much to ensure we had everything we needed, never once complaining, never once asking for anything in return. Your love has shaped us into the people we are today, and for that, we are forever grateful.<br><br>
                You taught us the true meaning of resilience, kindness, and hard work. You showed us that love is not just spoken but proven through actions. No matter how tough things got, you never let us feel alone. Your arms have always been a safe haven, your words a source of comfort, and your presence a reminder that we are deeply loved.<br>

                We are who we are because of you. You gave us more than just a home; you gave us a family filled with love, laughter, and unbreakable bonds. No gift could ever match what you have given us, but on this special day, I want you to know how deeply we cherish and appreciate you.<br><br>
                Mom, we love you more than words can say. You are our hero, our heart, and our greatest blessing.<br><br>
                With all our love,<br>
                Kenny
